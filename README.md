# know_your_company
Submission for TechTogether 2019

## Project Overview

Know Your Company is a chrome extension that displays information about the company whose website you are on.
Specifically, the pop-up window will return two pie charts for gender and ethnic diversity, as well as recent controversial news related
to the employer.

This project was built by @raphaelletseng, @miyakeilin, @gohsu, and @cclin130 at TechTogether Boston 2019. We chose to build this project to make company diversity
information more accessible. An organization's employee makeup is an important consideration for job-seekers, especially those in minority groups.
We also hope that by making this information easier to access, companies will become more self-aware of their workforce demographic.
